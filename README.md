# get
Small and simple package manager

## Why?
*get* is intended for use in smaller systems, such as homebrew'd video game consoles, where there is code execution but not a full stack of tools that package managers usually utilize, such as shell scripts or external libraries.

## Dependencies
The binary does not have any dependencies. To build the source, zlib is required.
